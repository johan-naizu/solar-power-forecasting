# Solar Power Generation Forecasting System
This project aims to predict solar power generation using machine learning models like LSTM, CNN, and CNN-LSTM hybrid models. The dataset used contains multivariate features such as temperature, cloud cover, shortwave flux, and engineered time features. The forecasting data is tailored for energy trading and analysis purposes.
